        "1.   **C is a low-level language.** To serve as a suitable language for systems programming, C provides access to machine-level concepts (bytes and addresses, for example) that other programming languages try to hide. C also provides operations that correspond closely to a computer’s built-in instructions, so that programs can be fast. Since application programs rely on it for input/output, storage management, and numerous other services, an operating system can’t afford to be slow.\n",
        "1.  **C is a small language.** C provides a more limited set of features than many languages. (The reference manual in the second edition of K&R covers the entire language in 49 pages.) To keep the number of features small, C relies heavily on a “library” of standard functions. (A “function” is similar to what other programming languages might call a “procedure,” “subroutine,” or “method.”)\n",
        "1. **C is a permissive language.** C assumes that you know what you’re doing, so it allows you a wider degree of latitude than many languages. Moreover, C doesn’t mandate the detailed error-checking found in other languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The C programming language emerged from the development of the UNIX operating system at Bell Laboratories by **Ken Thompson**, **Dennis Ritchie**, and others. Thompson initially created UNIX operating system for the DEC PDP-7,  an early minicomputer with just 8K of memory, using assembly language — an impressive achievement considering the technological constraints of 1969.\n",
        "\n",
        "Like other operating systems of the time, UNIX was written in assembly language. Programs written in assembly language are usually painful to debug and\n",
        "hard to enhance; UNIX was no exception. Thompson decided that a higher-level language was needed for the further development of UNIX, so he designed a small language named B, inspired by BCPL — a systems language derived from Algol 60.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Ritchie soon joined the UNIX project and began programming in B. In 1970, Bell Labs acquired a more advanced minicomputer a PDP-11 for the UNIX project. Once B was up and running on the PDP-11, Thompson rewrote a portion of UNIX in B. By 1971, it became apparent that B was not well-suited to the PDP-11, so Ritchie began to develop an extended version of B. He called his language NB (“New B”) at first, and then, as it began to diverge more from B, he changed the name to C. By 1973, UNIX was rewritten entirely in C, marking a pivotal shift. This transition granted UNIX unprecedented portability: by developing C compilers for other systems, the team could easily port UNIX across machines, cementing C’s role as a foundational tool for operating systems and software development.\n",

        "Additional uses of C are as follows:\n",
        "1. C is used to write driver programs for devices like tablets, printers etc.\n",
        "1. C language is used to program embedded systems where programs need to run\n",
        "faster in limited memory (UAV, Microwave, Cameras etc.)\n",
        "1. C is used to develop games, an area where latency is very important, i.e., the computer must react quickly to user input.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The versatility of C is by design. C strikes a balance between low-level machine operations and human-readable syntax.
