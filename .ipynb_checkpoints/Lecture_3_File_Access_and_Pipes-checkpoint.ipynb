    "The `file` is the most basic and fundamental abstraction in Linux. Linux follows the **everything-is-a-file** philosophy (although not as strictly as some other systems, such as Plan 9<sup><a href=\"#footnote1\">1</a></sup>). Consequently, much interaction occurs via reading of and writing to files, even when the object in question is not what you would consider a normal file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be accessed, a file must first be opened. Files can be opened for reading, writing, or both. An open file is referenced via a unique descriptor, a mapping from the metadata associated with the open file back to the specific file itself. Inside the Linux kernel, this descriptor is handled by an integer (of the C type `int`) called the **file descriptor**, abbreviated **fd**. File descriptors are shared with user space, and are used directly by user programs to access files. A large part of Linux system programming consists of opening, manipulating, closing, and otherwise using file descriptors.\n",

    "Any of the bytes within a file may be read from or written to. These operations start at a specific byte, which is one’s conceptual “location” within the file. This location is called the **file position** or **file offset**. The file position is an essential piece of the metadata that the kernel associates with each open file. When a file is first opened, the file position is zero. Usually, as bytes in the file are read from or written to, byte-by-byte, the file position increases in kind. The file position may also be set manually to a given value, even a value beyond the end of the file.\n",

    "The size of a file is measured in bytes and is called its **length**. The length, in other words, is simply the number of bytes in the linear array that make up the file. A file’s length can be changed via an operation called truncation. A file can be truncated to a new size smaller than its original size, which results in bytes being removed from the end of the file. Confusingly, given the operation’s name, a file can also be “truncated” to a new size larger than its original size. In that case, the new bytes (which are added to the end of the file) are filled with zeros. A file may be empty (that is, have a length of zero), and thus contain no valid bytes. The maximum file length, as with the maximum file position, is bounded only by limits on the sizes of the C types that the Linux kernel uses to manage files."

Multiple processes are free to read from and write to the same file at the same time. The results of such concurrent accesses rely on the ordering of the individual operations, and are\n",
